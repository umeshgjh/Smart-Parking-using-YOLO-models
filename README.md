Leveraging Object Detection for Efficient Parking Space Monitoring: A Benchmark of YOLO Models.

In the era of smart cities, where urban mobility is paramount, intelligent parking systems have emerged as a critical component for alleviating traffic congestion and enhancing user experience. Object detection is a crucial task in many computer vision applications, including parking lot monitoring systems that detect vacant spots or occupied spaces. The YOLO (You Only Look Once) family of realtime object detection models has gained significant traction due to its high accuracy and computational efficiency. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of several stateof-the-art YOLO variants, including YOLOv4, YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLO NASS for the specific task of parking vacancy/car detection. We conduct extensive experiments on publicly available datasets, assessing the models' performance in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP), inference speed, and model complexity. Our analysis focuses on the trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, considering the real-time requirements of parking monitoring systems. Additionally, we investigate the impact of various data augmentation techniques and transfer learning strategies on the models' performance. The results provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of each YOLO variant for parking vacancy detection, guiding researchers and practitioners in selecting the most suitable model for their specific applications and computational constraints. The results of this study pave the way for the development of intelligent parking systems that seamlessly integrate cutting-edge computer vision techniques, contributing to sustainable and efficient urban mobility solutions.
